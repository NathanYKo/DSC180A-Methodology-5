The answers to the following four prompts, which are meant to help you brainstorm for your Quarter 2 Project Proposal, due on December 2nd. For each prompt, state the question that you’re answering in bold and write your answer immediately underneath on a new line. Make sure you’ve familarized yourself with the Quarter 2 Project Proposal specifications before proceeding!
$\textbf{What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?}$
$\quad$ Jailbreaking LLMs by pitting two LLMs against each other
$\textbf{Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.}
$\quad$ I would like to see if we can alter the prompts so that it can achieve jailbreaking in less iterations.
$\textbf{What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?}
$\quad$ A potential change I would make is to see if there are other area of logic that we can exploit to the prompts. This could be a way to improve the jailbreaking as it can diversify the prompts.
$\textbf{What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?}$
Token level prompt injections seem like a technique worth exploring. This can be used to see if the LLMs have a change in performance.
