## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Jailbreaking LLMs by pitting two LLMs against each other

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to see if we can alter the prompts so that it can achieve jailbreaking in less iterations.

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I would make is to see if there are other areas of logic that we can exploit to the prompts. This could be a way to improve the jailbreaking as it can diversify the prompts.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Token level prompt injections seem like a technique worth exploring. This can be used to see if the LLMs have a change in performance.
